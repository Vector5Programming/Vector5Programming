Hi!
I'm working on a substantial project to kick off my School-year, so look out for that.

My sites:
- [Generate, Guide, Document and Develop](https://ggdd.glitch.me): This is a motivator and temporary tracker for my progress in a self-appointed project I'm calling GGDD
- [Stille's Blogging Page](https://thesilenttype.tk): Stories, tutorials and more. A simple page generated as a test for a blog I'd like to eventually use!

Useful sites:
